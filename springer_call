2 main purpose was to get first hand feedback from potential users of the data available

biomedcentral
abstracts are available from scigraph

wouldn't be available through the api that eddie bates provides

targetting students etc to play with the data
strengthen collaboration with external corporations

in ny office, there are some technicians but not a dedicated tech department

haven't thought about east coast bc springer nature doesnt have an it department

if we can develop a common theme/focus for an event

we wouldn't be the best hosting partner but would want to participate

putting markus in touch with NYU for them to be local partner

and involve sarah kate in the next call

at springer nature, every two weeks it can work on their own projects and they want to introduce themes to that.

markus to send info on the previous hack days

doh and nyu both have immature projects on how to take the data further - how to visualize it in meaningful ways, do text analysis, etc.
